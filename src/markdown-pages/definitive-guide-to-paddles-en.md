Choosing length, blade size, blade shape is not straightforward at all. In
addition your height, weight and board volume play a role. However, even most of
the leading paddle brands stick to rough guidelines based on those factors.

For most beginners those general guidelines are fine and usually they start with
adjustable paddles and can play around with length (I did exactly that in the
very beginning). But if you want to take it a step further, I would say, we can
do better than that. And I would argue that length of arms and length of torso
vs. legs are elements that should be taken into account.

Ultimately a large part of what is your paddling motion, is a pivoting of the
paddle shaft around the position of your lower hand in conjunction with hinging
at the hips. Obviously, relatively longer or shorter limbs and torso affect the
calculation quite a bit.
