title: 'Choosing the Right Paddle'
---

Choosing a paddle is not at all trivial. There are quite a few options when it
comes to paddle blade shapes and sizes or paddle material and flex. The answer
to those questions are usually determined by the kind of activity you want to
do - surfing, racing or touring - and by how much money you are willing to
spend.

When it comes to paddle length, however, things get really tricky. On top of
what you'll be using the paddle for, you have to take into account your
physiology, your technique and the board you'll be riding. That being said, even
most of the leading paddle brands stick to only relatively rough guidelines. So
we will make an effort here to get a little deeper into it and to demystifying
the issue of paddle length a bit further.

The analysis below is the basis of our proprietary
[Length Calculator](/en/paddles#calculator).

## Paddle Length

The information provided by brands and shops out there is useful, but fairly
basic. A brief summary of
[how some of the industry leaders look at the topic](#what-the-brands-say) of
paddle length can be found below.

For most beginners those general guidelines are fine and usually they start with
adjustable paddles and can play around with length (I did exactly that in the
very beginning). But if you want to take it a step further, I would say, we can
do better than that. And I would argue the length of arms and length of torso
vs. legs are elements that should be taken into account.

Ultimately a large part of what is your paddling motion, is a pivoting of the
paddle shaft around the position of your lower hand in conjunction with hinging
at the hips. It makes sense, that relatively longer or shorter limbs and torso
affect the calculation quite a bit.

Even the best brands and websites neglect a couple of things that I believe are
necessary to look at when really fine-tuning your decision. Most notably:

- Board volume in relation to the rider's weight
- Length of the paddle blade / length of the shaft
- Length of the rider's arms
- Length of the rider's torso in relation to the legs

### [_Kialoa_](https://kialoa.com/pages/choosing-a-stand-up-paddle)

_Kialoa_ keeps it extremely basic and some of the recommendations seem a little
outdated, now that for instance most SUP surfers use paddles at around exactly
their own height - or even shorter as boards get smaller with less floatation.

Then again they make excellent points with their "additional considerations"
below below, which are definitely in line with my in-depth approach.

**Length recommendations:**

- RACE: Add 4" - 10 " to your height
- SURF: Add 4" - 8" to your height
- WHITEWATER: Add 4" - 8" to your height
- ALL WATER: Add 6" - 10" to your height

_Take into consideration the following:_

- The majority of paddlers will fit in the middle of the range.
- If you have broader than average shoulders or longer arms, go to the high end
  of the range.
- If you paddle with a more upright style of paddling, go to the high end of the
  range.
- If you paddle with a more bent over style of paddling, go to the low end of
  the range.
- If you have shoulder or elbow problems, go to the low end of the range.
- These are general guidelines so please take into account your personal
  preferences and proper biomechanics for paddling.

### [_Quickblade_](http://www.quickbladepaddles.com/SUP-paddle-sizes)

_Quickblade_ goes a step further and adds the element of proportion to their own
paddle length to height chart, but keeps it rather basic also.

| Height       | Surfing | Racing | Touring |
| :----------- | :-----: | :----: | :-----: |
| 5'5" (165cm) |   +5"   |  +7"   |   +8"   |
| 6' (183cm)   |   +6"   |  +7"   |   +9"   |
| 6'5" (196cm) |   +6"   |  +8"   |  +10"   |

To be fair, _Quickblade_ founder Jim Terell in a video tutorial acknowledges
that wider than average shoulders and longer arms should make you consider going
up a couple of inches.

### [_Starboard_](https://sup.star-board.com/project/starboard-paddle-setup-chart-how-to-choose-the-perfect-sup-paddle)

_Starboard_ uses the exact basic recommendations found in the _Quickblade_
chart. I really like the quick overview of all the elements that go into
choosing a paddle (purpose, length, shape, flex) in one graphic guide though. It
is a fantastic starting point for anyone starting to think about buying a
paddle.

### _Naish_

_Naish_'s user manual of the 2019 season simply states that the recommended
length is "8” to 12” above head level".

### [_BluePlanet Surfshop_](https://www.blueplanetsurf.com/service/best-sup-paddle/)

I mention _BluePlanet_ here, because in my opinion they have the best guide out
there to date. They reduced the paddle length according to what experienced
paddlers use nowadays. You'll notice that their recommendation for length in
surfing for instance starts at _0% higher than a person's height_ which is
significantly shorter than what most brands recommend.

I believe this is a result of CEO Robert Stehlik's obsession with paddles and
the fact that he regularly updates his knowledge talking to local Hawaiian pros
such as Connor Baxter.
