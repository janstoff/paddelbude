My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole,
filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole
with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a [hobbit-hole][1], and that
means comfort.
