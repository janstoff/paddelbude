  "motivation-subheadline": "One of the most exciting and versatile physical activities, stand up paddling has been an absolute revelation to me when I started doing it not that long ago. It combines being in the outdoors, on the water with strength, skill and balance. The learning experience and progression is so much fun. And the wide range opportunities it opens - think stand up paddle foil surfing - are just amazing. So with great pleasure I will dedicate some of my time to present to you here all the things I enjoy about the sport, products I love, training routines and just generally things I learn along the way.",

  "paddles-introduction": "I would argue the paddle is by far the aspect of your SUP experience that requires the most tinkering and finesse to figure out. It is your main tool, the one you will be holding in your hands 100% of the time and the thing that provides you balance, grips the water and transfers your power and technique into momentum propelling your forward. That said, the paddle is also the most easily misunderstood technology involved in stand up paddling.",
