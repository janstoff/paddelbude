There are quite a few options when it\ncomes to paddle blade shapes and sizes or paddle material and flex. The answer\nto those questions are usually determined by the kind of activity you want to\ndo - surfing, racing or touring - and by how much money you are willing to\nspend.</p>\n<p>When it comes to paddle length, however, things get really tricky. On top of\nwhat you'll be using the paddle for, you have to take into account your\nphysiology, your technique and the board you'll be riding. That being said, even\nmost of the leading paddle brands stick to only relatively rough guidelines. So\nwe will make an effort here to get a little deeper into it and to demystifying\nthe issue of paddle length a bit further.</p>\n<p>The analysis below is the basis of our proprietary\n<a href=\"/paddelbude/en/paddles#calculator\">Length Calculator</a>.</p>\n<h2>Paddle Length</h2>\n<p>The information provided by brands and shops out there is useful, but fairly\nbasic. A brief summary of\n<a href=\"#what-the-brands-say\">how some of the industry leaders look at the topic</a> of\npaddle length can be found below.</p>\n<p>For most beginners those general guidelines are fine and usually they start with\nadjustable paddles and can play around with length (I did exactly that in the\nvery beginning). But if you want to take it a step further, I would say, we can\ndo better than that. And I would argue the length of arms and length of torso\nvs. legs are elements that should be taken into account.</p>\n<p>Ultimately a large part of what is your paddling motion, is a pivoting of the\npaddle shaft around the position of your lower hand in conjunction with hinging\nat the hips. It makes sense, that relatively longer or shorter limbs and torso\naffect the calculation quite a bit.</p>\n<p>Even the best brands and websites neglect a couple of things that I believe are\nnecessary to look at when really fine-tuning your decision. Most notably:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Board volume in relation to the rider's weight</li>\n<li>Length of the paddle blade / length of the shaft</li>\n<li>Length of the rider's arms</li>\n<li>Length of the rider's torso in relation to the legs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a id=\"what-the-brands-say\"></a> What Do the Leading Brands Say?</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://kialoa.com/pages/choosing-a-stand-up-paddle\"><em>Kialoa</em></a></h3>\n<p><em>Kialoa</em> keeps it extremely basic and some of the recommendations seem a little\noutdated, now that for instance most SUP surfers use paddles at around exactly\ntheir own height - or even shorter as boards get smaller with less floatation.</p>\n<p>Then again they make excellent points with their \"additional considerations\"\nbelow below, which are definitely in line with my in-depth approach.</p>\n<p><strong>Length recommendations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>RACE: Add 4\" - 10 \" to your height</li>\n<li>SURF: Add 4\" - 8\" to your height</li>\n<li>WHITEWATER: Add 4\" - 8\" to your height</li>\n<li>ALL WATER: Add 6\" - 10\" to your height</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Take into consideration the following:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The majority of paddlers will fit in the middle of the range.</li>\n<li>If you have broader than average shoulders or longer arms, go to the high end\nof the range.</li>\n<li>If you paddle with a more upright style of paddling, go to the high end of the\nrange.</li>\n<li>If you paddle with a more bent over style of paddling, go to the low end of\nthe range.</li>\n<li>If you have shoulder or elbow problems, go to the low end of the range.</li>\n<li>These are general guidelines so please take into account your personal\npreferences and proper biomechanics for paddling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.quickbladepaddles.com/SUP-paddle-sizes\"><em>Quickblade</em></a></h3>\n<p><em>Quickblade</em> goes a step further and adds the element of proportion to their own\npaddle length to height chart, but keeps it rather basic also.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Height</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Surfing</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Racing</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Touring</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">5'5\" (165cm)</td>\n<td align=\"center\">+5\"</td>\n<td align=\"center\">+7\"</td>\n<td align=\"center\">+8\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">6' (183cm)</td>\n<td align=\"center\">+6\"</td>\n<td align=\"center\">+7\"</td>\n<td align=\"center\">+9\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">6'5\" (196cm)</td>\n<td align=\"center\">+6\"</td>\n<td align=\"center\">+8\"</td>\n<td align=\"center\">+10\"</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To be fair, <em>Quickblade</em> founder Jim Terell in a video tutorial acknowledges\nthat wider than average shoulders and longer arms should make you consider going\nup a couple of inches.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://sup.star-board.com/project/starboard-paddle-setup-chart-how-to-choose-the-perfect-sup-paddle\"><em>Starboard</em></a></h3>\n<p><em>Starboard</em> uses the exact basic recommendations found in the <em>Quickblade</em>\nchart. I really like the quick overview of all the elements that go into\nchoosing a paddle (purpose, length, shape, flex) in one graphic guide though. It\nis a fantastic starting point for anyone starting to think about buying a\npaddle.</p>\n<img src=\"https://340407-1049705-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Pick-a-perfect-paddle_V23.gif\" alt=\"image\" style=\"width:100%;\"/>\n<h3><em>Naish</em></h3>\n<p><em>Naish</em>'s user manual of the 2019 season simply states that the recommended\nlength is \"8” to 12” above head level\".</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.blueplanetsurf.com/service/best-sup-paddle/\"><em>BluePlanet Surfshop</em></a></h3>\n<p>I mention <em>BluePlanet</em> here, because in my opinion they have the best guide out\nthere to date. They reduced the paddle length according to what experienced\npaddlers use nowadays. You'll notice that their recommendation for length in\nsurfing for instance starts at <em>0% higher than a person's height</em> which is\nsignificantly shorter than what most brands recommend.</p>\n<p>I believe this is a result of CEO Robert Stehlik's obsession with paddles and\nthe fact that he regularly updates his knowledge talking to local Hawaiian pros\nsuch as Connor Baxter.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":null,"path":"/en/paddles/choosing-the-right-one","title":"Choosing the Right Paddle"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
