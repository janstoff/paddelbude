It is easy to fall in love with board designs, shapes and sizes.\nHowever, I would encourage all of you to prioritize the selection of a\nwell-designed paddle that fits your body type and activity (surfing, racing or\ncruising) over getting the coolest board any day.</p>\n<p>Not only is the paddle essential to your performance, but also injury and\nlongevity need to be considered. Poorly designed paddles or excessively long\npaddles can do some real damage long term.</p>\n<p>In addition, it is fair to say that carbon fiber paddles offer the perfect mix\nof low weight, performance and flex to make paddling enjoyable. And they are by\nfar the most expensive.</p>\n<p>Finally, a fixed-length paddle cut exactly to your size and purpose just feels\nthe best, it is smooth, it has balanced flex throughout the entire shaft, it\navoids give between connected parts and minimizes the need for maintenance.</p>\n<p>I would say roughly 80% of your enjoyment of SUPing comes from how your paddle\nfeels in your hand and how it transfers your energy into forward momentum on the\nwater. Make this your priority in terms of budget and depth of analysis.</p>\n<h2>Choosing the 'right' Paddle</h2>\n<p>Ultimately you'll want to know is what paddle to choose. If you want to jump\nahead and do so consult our\n<a href=\"/paddelbude/en/paddles/choosing-the-right-one\">Choosing the Right Paddle Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Here below we will set the foundational understanding on the fundamentals of\nshapes, sizes and material of <strong>shafts</strong> and <strong>blades</strong> and the associated\ngeneral characteristics.</p>\n<h2>The Shaft</h2>\n<h3>Materials</h3>\n<p>Note: Some manufacturers use fiberglass on the inside of the shaft and coat it\nin carbon fiber for marketing purposes. However, this is usually reflected in\nthe price and easily detected by the weight.</p>\n<h3>Flex</h3>\n<p>Stiffness S40 (Starboard)</p>\n<h4>Oval / Round</h4>\n<p>Oval -> stiffer, Round -> more flex</p>\n<h3>Thickness</h3>\n<h3>Tapered / Not Tapered</h3>\n<h3>Fixed vs. Adjustable vs. Travel</h3>\n<p>Generally, fixed paddles maximize performance, don’t take on water and are\ngenerally maintenance-free, whereas adjustable paddles maximize the ability to\naccommodate varying heights but sacrifice performance, can take on water and\nsink, and require regular cleaning and maintenance.</p>\n<h2>The Blade</h2>\n<h3>Shape</h3>\n<h4>Surface</h4>\n<img src=\"https://www.rei.com/dam/van_dragt_091317_0037_sup_paddle_blade_shapes.jpg\" alt=\"image\" style=\"width:200px;\"/>\n<h5>Teardrop</h5>\n<h5>Rectangular</h5>\n<h4>Tip</h4>\n<h5>Flat</h5>\n<h5>Rounded</h5>\n<img src=\"https://340407-1049705-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Starboard-SUP-Stand-Up-Paddleboard-Paddle-Key-Features-2020-lima-ltd-blade.jpg\" alt=\"image\" style=\"width:60%;\"/>\n<p>Smoother entry and exit of the paddle stroke. Simple and easy to use offering\nlots of stability in the water, which makes it a great feature for both\nbeginners and advanced paddlers (e.g. Starboard's \"Lima\" line).</p>\n<p>This makes it a great choice if you are paddling at a high cadence. It takes\ntremendous skill to maintain perfect technique and a clean catch during faster\nstrokes. That is why the forgiving nature of a rounded tip is helpful here -\nespecially if combined with a more rectangular shape of the blade.</p>\n<p>Generally this shape is optimised for use in flatwater rather than in the surf.</p>\n<h4>Curve</h4>\n<h4>Surface</h4>\n<h5>Di-hedral</h5>\n<h5>Double Concave</h5>\n<h3>Offset</h3>\n<p>Offset describes the degree that the blade angles forward from the shaft. The\nsize of that angle affects how vertical the blade is when it travels through the\nwater, which in turn can affect how much power you get out of each stroke.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to spend much time scrutinizing offset angles unless you enjoy\nanalyzing the finer details of your gear. That being said, here are some general\noffset recommendations based on different styles of paddling:</p>\n<p>For SUP surfing: approximately 7 degrees</p>\n<p>For all-around paddling/mixed use: approximately 10 degrees</p>\n<p>For SUP racing: approximately 12 degrees</p>\n<h3>Size</h3>\n<p>Reactangular bottom design is usually applied in smaller paddle blades which</p>\n<h3>Core</h3>\n<p>Core materials can vary in quality which is typically expressed in it's weight.\nCommon materials are PVC and PU foam.</p>\n<h3>Topics to consider</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Flex (Materials: Aluminium, Fiberglass, Carbon Fiber)</li>\n<li>Blade Size -> Cadence</li>\n<li>Shaft length (round / oval | tapered or not)</li>\n<li>Hand Position in relation to arm length</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":null,"path":"/en/paddles/definitive-guide","title":"The Definitive Guide to Paddles"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
