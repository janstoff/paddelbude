Here’s a\nsimple way to figure out where to put your hands: Grab the T-grip on the end of\nthe paddle with one hand and the shaft of the paddle with your other hand. Raise\nthe paddle above your head so it is in line with your shoulders and rest the\nshaft on your head. While still holding the T-grip with one hand, position your\nother hand on the shaft so that both arms form 90-degree angles at the elbows.\nThis is where you want your hands positioned on the paddle while paddling. It’s\nhelpful to mark the spot on the shaft with a piece of colorful tape so you can\nquickly grab the paddle in the right place. When you’re using the paddle, don’t\nover-grip it. A light grasp on the T-grip and shaft is all you need.</p>\n<h2>Stroke Phases</h2>\n<h3>Catch</h3>\n<p>Most experts will agree on this point: getting a clean catch is arguably the\nmost most important part of the stoke. The idea is to reach forward and fully\ninsert the blade by slicing it into the water from the side and/or straight down\nbefore applying power to the blade. If you start pulling before the blade is\nfully submerged, turbulence from the blade edges create air pockets that get\npulled down and create slippage, reducing the efficiency and effectiveness of\nthe whole stroke.</p>\n<h3>Pull</h3>\n<p>This is where you apply your skill, strength and explosiveness to generate\noptimal forward momentum.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to apply power to the stroke. Without getting into too much\ndetail, most beginners can start by pulling and pushing using only the arms. To\nmake the stroke more powerful and efficient, work on engaging the whole body by\nusing a torso twist and by pushing down with your top hand, using gravity to\nlean your body weight into the stroke while pulling with only a slight bend in\nyour lower arm. Avoid pulling the paddle past the feet.</p>\n<h3>Exit</h3>\n<p>Feathering the blade allows the paddle a smooth exit close to the rail and feet.\nAs you end the power phase, use a twisting motion of the top hand (pointing\nthumb forward) to feather the power face of the blade away from the body as you\nlift the paddle up with your bottom arm and start moving the blade forward into\nthe recovery.</p>\n<h3>Recover</h3>\n<p>A clean exit makes the blade come out easily and move back into the reach\nposition quickly and almost effortlessly which gives you a chance to relax,\ninhale and re-set the body for another clean stroke.</p>\n<h2>Strokes</h2>\n<h3>Forward Stroke</h3>\n<h3>Reverse Stroke</h3>\n<h3>Sweep Stroke</h3>\n<h3>Draw Stroke</h3>\n<h3>J Stroke</h3>\n<h3>Cross-Bow Stroke</h3>\n<h2>Training Cues</h2>\n<p>A good way to check the efficiency of your stroke is to listen. On a calm, quiet\nday, listen to your stroke. If there is a lot of splashing when you enter the\nwater, focus on getting a cleaner catch- slice the blade into the water smoothly\ninstead of splashing it down into the water. If there is a lot of gurgling\nduring the power phase, make sure to plant the whole blade and slow down the\nblade movement. The speed of the blade should match the speed of the board\nmoving past the planted blade. If you are throwing water behind you or have a\nsplashy exit, focus on the feathering and getting a smooth, clean exit out of\nthe water. If you are executing a stroke correctly, the stroke should feel very\nsmooth, efficient, powerful and quiet.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":null,"path":"/en/technique/paddling","title":"Paddling"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
