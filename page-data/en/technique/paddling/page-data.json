Here’s a\nsimple way to figure out where to put your hands: Grab the T-grip on the end of\nthe paddle with one hand and the shaft of the paddle with your other hand. Raise\nthe paddle above your head so it is in line with your shoulders and rest the\nshaft on your head. While still holding the T-grip with one hand, position your\nother hand on the shaft so that both arms form 90-degree angles at the elbows.\nThis is where you want your hands positioned on the paddle while paddling. It’s\nhelpful to mark the spot on the shaft with a piece of colorful tape so you can\nquickly grab the paddle in the right place. When you’re using the paddle, don’t\nover-grip it. A light grasp on the T-grip and shaft is all you need.</p>\n<h2>Stroke Phases</h2>\n<h3>Catch</h3>\n<p>Most experts will agree on this point: getting a clean catch is arguably the\nmost most important part of the stoke. The idea is to reach forward and fully\ninsert the blade by slicing it into the water from the side and/or straight down\nbefore applying power to the blade. If you start pulling before the blade is\nfully submerged, turbulence from the blade edges create air pockets that get\npulled down and create slippage, reducing the efficiency and effectiveness of\nthe whole stroke.</p>\n<h3>Power</h3>\n<p>This is where you apply your skill, strength and explosiveness to generate\noptimal forward momentum.</p>\n<p>Falling / leaning onto the blade. Powerfully folding your whole body forward\nwith a slight sitting back motion. Then explode back up / ahead from your hips\nto get the board to shoot forward.</p>\n<p>Another way to think about this, is bringing your body towards the blade (rather\nthan pulling the blade towards your body).</p>\n<p>A gentle grip on the paddle helps focussing on generating power from the entire\nbody than rather than the arms.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to apply power to the stroke. Without getting into too much\ndetail, most beginners can start by pulling and pushing using only the arms. To\nmake the stroke more powerful and efficient, work on engaging the whole body by\nusing a torso twist and by pushing down with your top hand, using gravity to\nlean your body weight into the stroke while pulling with only a slight bend in\nyour lower arm. Avoid pulling the paddle past the feet.</p>\n<p>End your stroke around when you bottom arm reaches you torso. After that your\nenergy is no longer applied in the most efficient way and you should exit the\nstroke.</p>\n<h3>Exit</h3>\n<p>Feathering the blade allows the paddle a smooth exit close to the rail and feet.\nAs you end the power phase, use a twisting motion of the top hand (pointing\nthumb forward) to feather the power face of the blade away from the body as you\nlift the paddle up with your bottom arm and start moving the blade forward into\nthe recovery.</p>\n<h3>Recover</h3>\n<p>Exiting the blade from the water correctly and smoothly will allow you to\nrecover with minimal distraction and prepare you for a clean and fast reaching\nmotion. The recover phase is all about re-setting yourself and relaxing.</p>\n<p>Relaxation is key here and something paddling guru John Puakea puts emphasis on\nmassively. He recommends during practice to do a body check once you reach\nforward 'Am I relaxed?', if not 'relax your arms, relax your neck, relax your\nface', noting that \"if you want to be fast, you need to be relaxed. Only the\nmuscles that make you move forward should be used.\" You should \"lock your body\ntogether\" only once your blade fully engages.</p>\n<h2>Stroke Techniques</h2>\n<p>Find the different <a href=\"/paddelbude/en/technique/paddling/strokes\">Stroke Techniques</a></p>\n<p>A good way to check the efficiency of your stroke is to listen. On a calm, quiet\nday, listen to your stroke. If there is a lot of splashing when you enter the\nwater, focus on getting a cleaner catch- slice the blade into the water smoothly\ninstead of splashing it down into the water. If there is a lot of gurgling\nduring the power phase, make sure to plant the whole blade and slow down the\nblade movement. The speed of the blade should match the speed of the board\nmoving past the planted blade. If you are throwing water behind you or have a\nsplashy exit, focus on the feathering and getting a smooth, clean exit out of\nthe water. If you are executing a stroke correctly, the stroke should feel very\nsmooth, efficient, powerful and quiet.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":null,"path":"/en/technique/paddling","title":"Paddling"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
